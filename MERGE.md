# 🚀 Merge Instructions for Multi-File Support Renaming

This document provides instructions for merging the `feature/improved-rag-step4` branch back to `main`. We've just completed a massive refactoring that transforms our PDF-only app into a super-powered multi-format file chat machine! 🎉

## 🎯 What's Included in This Feature

**Step 4: Complete Multi-File Support Renaming (The Great Refactor)**
- ✅ **Frontend Files**: `PDFUpload.tsx` → `FileUpload.tsx`, `pdfProcessor.ts` → `fileProcessor.ts`
- ✅ **Backend Interfaces**: All PDF-specific classes renamed to generic file classes
- ✅ **State Management**: Updated all state variables (`pdfs` → `files`, `selectedPDFs` → `selectedFiles`)
- ✅ **UI/UX**: Updated all text and labels to reflect multi-file support
- ✅ **Browser Storage**: Updated storage keys (`pdf_chat_files` → `file_chat_files`)
- ✅ **Documentation**: Updated all README files to reflect multi-format support
- ✅ **Interface Exports**: Properly exported shared interfaces from API service
- ✅ **File Deletion**: Added complete file deletion functionality with UI controls
- ✅ **File Deletion**: Added complete file deletion functionality with UI controls in Upload Files tab
- ✅ **Component Synchronization**: Chat component now reflects file deletions from Upload tab
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Fixed backend to properly remove files from all storage locations

## 🎨 What This Means for Users

Your app now speaks the language of **all the files**! 📁✨
- **PDFs** (.pdf) - Still the OG, with full text extraction
- **Markdown** (.md) - For all your documentation needs
