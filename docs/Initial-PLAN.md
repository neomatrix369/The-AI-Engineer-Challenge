# Plan to Implement PDF Upload, Indexing, and RAG System

## Overview

We'll modify the application to support:

- **PDF Upload:** Users can upload PDF files through the frontend  
- **PDF Indexing:** Use the `aimakerspace` library to extract text and create embeddings  
- **RAG Chat:** Chat with the uploaded PDF content using retrieval-augmented generation

## Phase 1: Backend Modifications

### 1.1 Update Dependencies

- Add PDF processing libraries (`PyPDF2` or `pypdf`)
- Add file upload handling capabilities
- Ensure all `aimakerspace` dependencies are available

### 1.2 Create New API Endpoints

- `POST /api/upload-pdf`: Handle PDF file uploads
- `POST /api/chat-with-pdf`: Enhanced chat endpoint for RAG functionality
- `GET /api/documents`: List uploaded documents
- `DELETE /api/documents/{doc_id}`: Remove documents

### 1.3 Implement PDF Processing Service

- PDF text extraction
- Text chunking for optimal embedding
- Integration with `aimakerspace.vectordatabase`
- Document storage and management

### 1.4 Enhance Chat System

- Modify existing chat endpoint to support RAG
- Implement context retrieval from vector database
- Update prompt engineering for RAG responses

## Phase 2: Frontend Modifications

### 2.1 Create PDF Upload Component

- Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- File validation and progress indicators
- Upload status feedback

### 2.2 Enhance Chat Interface

- Add document selection/context awareness
- Show which documents are being used for responses
- Display document sources in chat responses

### 2.3 Add Document Management UI

- List uploaded documents
- Document deletion functionality
- Document status indicators

## Phase 3: Integration and Testing

### 3.1 Connect Frontend and Backend

- Update API service to handle new endpoints
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states and user feedback

### 3.2 Testing and Optimization

- Test PDF processing with various file types
- Optimize chunking and embedding strategies
- Performance testing for large documents

Let me start implementing this plan by creating a feature branch and beginning with the backend modifications.
